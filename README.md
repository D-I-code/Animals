##Why Are We Doing This?

With this project we will be able to learn how to build a basic backend Java service using Spring Boot API with CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functionality.
The program will be able to perform operations using a MySQL database in response to HTTP requests, demonstrating our understanding of the ability to direct and how the flow of tada works in a manner similar to production software.
We will be also demonstrating our understanding of software design through detailed project management, source control, throughout testing and documentation.

##How to open the file.
The user has to have Java 11 or above installed and has to go to the terminal and use the command `java -jar animals-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` .

##How I Expected the Challenge To Go.

I was able to implement my knowledge gained during the course and I was confident getting the functionality of the program working.
My main concerns were the testing aspects and coverage.

##What Went Well/ What Didn’t Go As Planned?

I was pleased to see that my service and controller classes were working well and there were no errors. Postman was responding to the http requests and everything was running smoothly.
Writing the unit tests took me a bit of time to get into the right mindset, there were a couple of methods I initially struggled to work out how to test, but in the end I got them all done and achieved over 83% coverage so I was pleased with that. I was happy to see my CRUD tests and Postman working after a fixing couple of methods. I’ve managed to complete my unit and integration tests.

##Possible Improvements For Future Revisions Of The Project.

It would be ideal to create a front end, providing a user interface to submit requests rather than using Postman. For myself, one of the things I will be looking to expand my knowledge on in the future is some front end programming so I can be able to carry out some of the data validation at source, rather than allowing invalid data to be submitted to the API.
